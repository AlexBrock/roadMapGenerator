# roadMapGenerator

Custom code generator for road map page. Interface for adding/editing/removing road map items, developed to be used locally without the need to setup a server. As such this will only work in firefox or safari as we are referencing a local json file, a json file which needs to be overwritten by the generated file when ever changes are made.

# How to use:
<ol>
<li> open index.html</li>
<li> edit road map items</li>
<li> click the code tab</li>
<li> when save dialog shows, press ok and move from downloads folder to the index folder and overwrite roadMap.json</li>
<li> copy and paste the generated code.</li>
</ol>
